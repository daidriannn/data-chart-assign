				<h1>Mortgage Rates Fluctuate More Than the Tides Rise & Fall with the Moon Phases</h1>

            <h2><i>Mortgage Rates appear to almost be unpredicatable and dependent on the economic state of the country. From 1974 to 2021 the trend has been hard to track, The Mortgage Report captures the different percentages that effect how Americans pay for their homes.</h2></i>

	<p>After the pandemic and a surplus of spending, the economy became to robust. According to The Mortgage Report, "Extremely high prices and an overall strong economy have led the Federal Reserve to take aggressive measures against inflation this year, including four historic rate hikes of 75 basis points (0.75%) each in June, July, September, and November."</p>

	<p>There are multiple factors to consider when trying to determine how fluctating interest rates will effect the average American. For example, people with good credit and low debt-to-income ratios are more likely to get rates well below the industry norm. </p>

    <p>Over the timespan of 30 years, starting in 1974, mortgage rates have spiked and fallen with no particular pattern. In recent history, there was the housing crisis of 2008. Moments like those illuminate just how costly it can become for average Americans to purchase homes due to high interest rates. </p>
